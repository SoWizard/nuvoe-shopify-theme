We love our refillable water bottles - we have one with us all the time - but they do come with their own annoyances & problems.

We also hate that funky smell and 'off' taste that can slowly develop throughout the day no matter how much we rinse it out; and the daily chore of washing to keep the water tasting great does become tiresome.<\/p><p>As product developers we have an inherent passion to solve problems that we see around us and so we set off to design a product that upgrades our existing water bottle with self-cleaning and keep us using our bottles every day knowing the water is as clean and fresh as it can be.
